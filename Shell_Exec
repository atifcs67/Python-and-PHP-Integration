Python and PHP Integration

I am computer science professional while I was working on my FYP. I had spent most of the time on how to run python code 
from server side i.e. PHP. Because I wanted to show the results on (front-end) HTML. Also after my graduation so many student 
contact me about it. Then I decided to write a small guide on Python and PHP integration.

Today I am going to guide you step by step that how you will execute you python code from your server side (PHP- code).

1.	Save both python and PHP files in the same directory (mandatory).
2.	Use Shell_Exce function in your PHP code.
  i.	Shell_Exec( ) fuction can take two parameters.
  ii.	1st parameter is the python installation directory path on your machine/PC. Python installation directory path likely be, 
        e.g.  C:/Users/Atif/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/python
  iii.	2nd parameter is the name of python file with .py extension that you want to execute e.g. myFile.py
  iv.	Below is the example of shell_exec (1st para space 2nd para).
              
              Shell_Exec ('C:/Users/Atif/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python36-32/python	myFile.py');
